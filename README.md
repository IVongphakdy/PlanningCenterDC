Internship Design Challenge 2019

Isaac Vongphakdy

This challenge is pretty straightforward:
  - Recreate the UI shown in the attached image as accurately as you
can.
  - Use any flavor of HTML/CSS you like.
  - Take up to a day to complete the challenge and deliver the code to us in the manner you find suitable. We will make a note of the time the code challenge has been sent and start the 24hr clock from there.â€¨
  - Assume the latest version of Chrome as your only target browser.

We're always learning new things on the design team. If you're looking
for ways to show off, focus on these:
  - Style the states of interactable elements (be subtle).
  - Use BEM naming conventions for your selectors.
  - Post your solution on Github (or similar). Good Luck!
